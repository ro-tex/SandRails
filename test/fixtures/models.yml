# Read about fixtures at http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/FixtureSet.html

# This model initially had no columns defined.  If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
one: {}
# column: value
#
two: {}
#  column: value
mod:
  field: I'm a model! Look at me - got a field, too!
  # This 'category: things' will set up a 'belongs_to' link to 'things' which is a 'category'.
  # category: things # 'things' must exist in fixtures/categories.yml

# This ERB code will conveniently generate 10 model objects for us:
<% 10.times do |n| %>
mod_<%= n %>:
  field: <%= "field#{n}" %>
<% end %>
