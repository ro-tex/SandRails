How does this work? What are the allowed methods passed? Can we use it in other block-passing cases?
  [1, 2, 3].map(&:to_s)

Yo, check this out!
  ["1", "2", "3"].map(&method(:Integer))

If you want to use RSpec, start with `rails generate rspec:install` or `rspec --init` (in case you're not using Rails)

If you have both RSpec test and ActiveSupport::TestCase tests, you can run them like this:
$ rspec # RSpec
$ rake # RSpec but noisy - it will output some extra stuff
$ rake test # ActiveSupport::TestCase
